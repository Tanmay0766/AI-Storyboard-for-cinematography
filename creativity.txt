I was traveling deep into the woods, my boots crunching against the damp, mossy ground. The dense canopy above filtered the sunlight into golden streaks, creating an otherworldly glow. The deeper I went, the quieter the world became, as if the forest itself were holding its breath.

A map in my hand, hastily sketched by a local villager, guided me toward a place few had ever seen. “Follow the stream until you find the stone arch,” he had said, his voice laced with mystery. “Beyond that lies something… unforgettable.”

The sound of trickling water led me to the stream, its crystal-clear surface reflecting the green of the trees. Hours passed, and just as fatigue began to creep in, I saw it—the stone arch, ancient and weathered, standing tall like a forgotten gateway. Vines crept along its edges, and strange symbols were etched into its surface.

I stepped through, and the air changed instantly. The forest beyond was unlike anything I’d seen. Trees taller than skyscrapers loomed above, their trunks glowing faintly. Flowers the size of my head bloomed in colors I couldn’t name, and the air was filled with a soft, melodic hum.

As I wandered deeper, I noticed movement—a figure cloaked in green, blending seamlessly with the foliage. It turned, revealing a face that was both human and not, with eyes that shimmered like moonlight.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” it said, its voice echoing like wind through leaves.

Before I could respond, the forest itself seemed to come alive, vines curling toward me, not in malice, but as if guiding me back. I turned to run, the archway just visible in the distance.

When I finally emerged, the world felt different—quieter, heavier. The forest had let me go, but it had left me with a secret I could never truly explain.
